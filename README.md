# Cognizat-Virtual-Internship

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Gala Groceries, a technology-led grocery store chain in the USA, seeks to leverage new technologies, particularly IoT, to gain a competitive advantage over other grocery stores. They pride themselves on offering high-quality, fresh produce sourced from local suppliers. However, ensuring consistent delivery of this objective throughout the year poses significant challenges.

To address a supply chain issue, Gala Groceries has approached Cognizant for assistance. Groceries are highly perishable, and finding the right balance between stocking too much or too little is crucial. The client wants to improve their stocking strategy and seeks insights from data analysis.

The first step is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and formulate meaningful questions and recommendations. At the end of the analysis, a summary of findings and suggestions will be provided to address Gala Groceries' business problem.

## Task 2: Data Modeling

Based on the recommendations, Gala Groceries aims to focus on the following problem statement:

"Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis to optimize procurement from suppliers?"

To address this problem, the client has agreed to share additional data in the form of sensor data. The sensors measure temperature in storage facilities and track stock levels in refrigerators and freezers in stores.

The task is to review the provided data model diagram and determine which data to utilize from the available sources. Additionally, a strategic plan will be devised to leverage this data to answer the problem statement effectively.

## Task 3: Model Building and Interpretation

With the data modeling phase complete, it's time to proceed with machine learning. Gala Groceries has provided three datasets, and the task is to combine, transform, and model these datasets in a suitable manner to address the defined problem statement.

Upon completing the modeling process, the analysis and results need to be communicated effectively to the business. A PowerPoint slide will be created to present the findings, ensuring the language used is business-friendly and the results are presented in a manner understandable to non-technical stakeholders.

## Task 4: Machine Learning Production

Having observed promising results from the machine learning model, Gala Groceries believes that with more data and time, it can bring substantial value to the business. However, to operationalize the model, it needs to be converted from a Python notebook to a production-ready Python module.

As the Data Scientist responsible for creating the algorithm, the task is to prepare a Python module that includes code for training the model and generating performance metrics when the file is executed.

## Task 5: Quality Assurance

The ML engineering team has taken the Python module and deployed the algorithm into production with the assistance of the DevOps team. Before going live, the DevOps team collected predictions from the algorithm and performed testing against actual results for the "estimated_stock_pct" variable. The ML engineering team wants to discuss questions about the algorithm to further enhance the model's performance before integration with Gala Groceries' live system.
